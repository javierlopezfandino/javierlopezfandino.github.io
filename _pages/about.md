I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2012 and the Master's in Information Technology in 2014 at the [Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (USC)](https://www.usc.gal/en). I obtained the PhD. in Computer Science Research at the same university in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dora B. Heras and Prof. Dr. Francisco Argüello. Since 2022, I have been an Assistant Professor in the Computer Architecture and Technology branch of the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at USC.

I am part of the collaborator research staff of [Centro Singular de Investigación en Tecnoloxías Intelixentes (CiTIUS)](https://citius.gal/team/javier-lopez-fandino/) and [Galician Centre for Mathematical Research and Technology (CITMAga)](https://citmaga.gal/en/).

My main research areas cover high performance computing and remote sensing, with special emphasis on optimizing GPU processing for multidimensional remote sensing images. My work focuses on the development of efficient techniques for the detection of anomalies and changes within multi-temporal data sets that can be projected onto commodity GPU and edge-computing hardware for processing in real-time scenarios. I am also interested on the classification of these types of images using advanced neural networks and Deep Learning methodologies.
